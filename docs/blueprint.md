## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Lavender (#E6E6FA), chosen for its association with calmness, healing, and the nursing profession. It conveys a sense of serenity and trustworthiness, inviting users to engage with the app in a relaxed state.
- Background color: A very light lavender (#F5F5FF). This provides a soft, unobtrusive backdrop that complements the primary color without overwhelming the user. Its lightness enhances readability and contributes to an airy feel.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080), used to highlight interactive elements and key information. Teal balances the gentle lavender with a touch of invigoration, hinting at health, vitality, and growth.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for titles and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body. This combination brings personality to titles, for short eye-catching blocks of text. If any text is lengthy or in paragraph format, Alegreya will be easy and gentle on the eyes.
- Use clear, concise icons that align with nursing and medical themes.
- Subtle animations on button hovers, loading states, and quiz transitions. Framer-Motion can smoothly handle transitions to avoid hard cuts.
- A clean and intuitive layout, including navigation elements for a straightforward user experience.
